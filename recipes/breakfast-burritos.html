    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package bacon</li>
        <li>10 large eggs</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 cups frozen hash brown potatoes with peppers and onion (such as Ore-Ida® Potatoes O'Brien®)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>10 sheets aluminum foil</li>

</html>  </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels and crumble into bits. Keep the skillet warm.</li>
        <li>Whisk together eggs, milk, and salt in a bowl until combined. Pour into the hot skillet. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until eggs are scrambled and set, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add frozen potatoes, garlic salt, and pepper. Fry until browned on the bottom, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and cook until other side is browned, 4 to 5 minutes more. Let cool.</li>
        <li>Lay 10 sheets of aluminum foil, slightly larger than tortillas, on a flat work surface. Lay 1 tortilla on each aluminum foil piece; evenly distribute Cheddar cheese on top. Add scrambled eggs, bacon bits, salsa, and potatoes to each tortilla, in that order. Tightly roll burritos, tucking tops and bottoms in first.</li>
        <li>Wrap aluminum foil tightly around each burrito, covering it completely. Place in resealable plastic bags in a single layer. Remove as much air as possible from the bags before sealing. Store in the freezer until ready to reheat.</li>
        <li>Reheat by removing the aluminum foil, placing burrito on a microwave-safe plate, and covering it with a paper towel. Heat in the microwave until evenly warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
